# SimuWebGPU

This project is a port of my OpenGL particle simulator to WebGPU. OpenGL is pretty archaic technology by today's standards and I am beggining to be convinced of the wonders of cross platform gpu development on the web. Because of this, I have been spending a good amount of time learning webgpu and I plan to continiously update this project as I learn new things.
